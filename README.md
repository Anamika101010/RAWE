Rural Agricultural Work Experience Program (RAWE) -
RAWE program was designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills by providing us with hands on experience by working on farmers' field or their homes. 
We were attached to a village for a few weeks and got acquainted with the on farm practical problems. The program aims to provide us with exposure to the real-world challenges faced by rural farmers, such as crop management, soil conservation, livestock management and rural entrepreneurship. Additionally, the program also helped us to develop communication and interpersonal skills by engaging with farmers and rural communities.

Overall, the RAWE program provided us an opportunity to apply our theoretical knowledge to real-world situations, while gaining valuable practical experience and understanding of rural life and agriculture.
